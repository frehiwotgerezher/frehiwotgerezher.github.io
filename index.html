        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a well-skilled and adaptable professional with a BSC degree in Electrical and 
		  Computer Engineering. With a diverse background encompassing roles in both academia and industry, I have cultivated a 
		  unique blend of theoretical knowledge and practical expertise. From technical 
		  positions in a telecom company to serving as an assistant lecturer at a university 
		  and as a Test Engineer (ATE) at Silicon-Service/Teradyne, I have honed my 
		  abilities to effectively bridge the gap between theory and application. With a strong 
		  foundation in communication engineering, I am eager to contribute more on 
		  various technical environments and involve myself in driving innovative solutions to complex projects.
